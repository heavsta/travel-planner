# Travel Planner - Udacity Capstone Project
This is the last project from *Udacity Frontend Nanodegree*. This project aims to give us the opportunity to put all of the skills we have learned into one project to build our own custom travel app.

# Configuration
To run this app successfully, we'll use three different APIs:
- [Geonames API](http://www.geonames.org/export/web-services.html)
- [Weatherbit API](https://www.weatherbit.io/account/create)
- [Pixabay API](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/)

# Running
Here are the necessary command lines to run the project successfully:
1. `npm i` to install all the dependecies
2. `npm run build-prod` to build production files
3. `npm run build-dev` to run webpack developer server
4. `npm run start` to run local node server and start the application
5. `npm run test` to test the app
